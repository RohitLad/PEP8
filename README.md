# PEP8 guidelines

## Python Enhancement Proposals

## Recommendations:

- Use spaces instead of tabs
- Use 4 spaces for intendation
- Limit each line to a maximum of 79 characters, this helps with code readibility

## Imports

- Be as specific as possible with imports
```
# Do
from time import time
# Or
import time
# instead of
from time import *
```
